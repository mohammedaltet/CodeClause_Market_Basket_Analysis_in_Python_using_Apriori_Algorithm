# CodeClause_project_Market_Basket_Analysis_in_Python_using_Apriori_Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm is the most popular algorithm for mining association rules. It finds the most frequent combinations in a database and identifies the rules of association between elements, based on 3 important factors:

- Support: the probability that X and Y meet
- Confidence: the conditional probability that Y knows x. In other words, how often does Y occur when X came first.
- Lift: the relationship between support and confidence. An increase of 2 means that the probability of buying X and Y together is twice as high as the probability of simply buying Y.

in this project, we used the Apriori algorithm to find the relation between items
